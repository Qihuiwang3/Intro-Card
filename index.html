            My name is Qihui, I am a junior majoring in Computer Science people and media thread. I am from China and
            transferred to
            GT in Spring 2022 from Penn State. The reason why I want to join Bits of good is because I love to get to
            know and work with people who
            have different culture. I like to watch movies, play tennis, and also play with my three lovely cats during
            my spare.
            time.
